# Wat if we can modify the function or be able to change

# Function with input
# def my_function(something):
#     Do this with something
#     then do this with something
#     Finally do this with something

# Function that allows for input

def greet_with_name (name):
    print(f"Hello {name}")
    print(f"How do you do {name}")

greet_with_name("Sandra")
